# PostShift

PostShift is a decision engine for people who work irregular shifts.

It models energy, recovery, and cognitive load instead of pretending time
is evenly distributed across a calendar.

This tool exists to answer one question:
"What am I actually capable of doing after this shift?"

## What it does (v0)

- Models work, sleep, and recovery blocks
- Projects energy states across time
- Matches tasks to energy, not hours
- Warns when recovery debt is accumulating

This is logic-first software.
UI comes later.
